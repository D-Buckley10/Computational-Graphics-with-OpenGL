# CS-330-Portfolio
Week Eight Journal Portfolio Submission


*1. How do I approach designing software?
  -What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  -What design process did you follow for your project work?
  -How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

    When it comes to the approach of how I design software, one of the first steps I attempt to do is gather as much information about the assignment as possible. In the academic setting, this would entail reading through the rubric and verifying all of the tasks that need to be completed in order to receive full credit for the assignment. After this, I gather these requirements and form a checklist of what needs to be accomplished. I usually attempt to write pseudocode for designing my software, but found this rather challenging in this course due to having a hard time grasping the concepts of OpenGL. I ended up living in tutorials on forums and YouTube attempting to understand the concepts, which helped but made the development of my software rather late. I still intend to use my checklist method and pseudocode (when applicable) for future software, one of the key changes I need to work on however is my time management. 

*2. How do I approach developing programs?
  -What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  -How did iteration factor into your development?
  -How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

      I attempt to develop my programs with efficiency and consistancy, however in this case it involved a lot of tutorials and trial and error on my part. I found myself doing a ton of debugging and research to understand what went wrong, and would often refer to tutorial videos provided from the school or Youtube to try learning about the mistake. The modules iterating into each other was a very beneficial concept when working on my program, as it allowed me to learn the concepts with just one shape (pyramid) and then transfer those concepts into the milestone assignments. One of the ways that my development has improved was through modularizing my code so that it was cleaner and easier to read and navigate through.

*3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational  pathway?
  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  
      One of the ways that I found computation graphics and visualizations can help with my educational pathway was by teaching me the importance of reading through documentation for answers to my problem. Referring to online forums can be useful, but often people are just looking for the answer, and not the reason to get to the answer. I would just need to understand how certain functions and operations worked, then I was able to easily fix any problems that existed in my program. Regarding my profesisonal pathway, computational graphics and cisualizations can help lead me into fields such as: game development for game engines, the automotive industry for things such as showing the car on the maps when navigation features are on, or even the scientific fields if generating physics based graphics. For personal gain, I now understand the relationship that my video-games have my computers graphics card and understanding the patch notes better. Even if I may not have felt the most confident in this class, I can definitely say that I have learned valuable knowledge from this course.
